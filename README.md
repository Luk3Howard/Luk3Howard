- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Luk3Howard
- Iâ€™m interested in developing my coding and tech skills to pursue a career change from Digital Marketing into something more tech-related.
- Iâ€™m currently learning HTML, CSS, Python and Django to help with professional and personal projects in areas such as website maintenance, email newsletter creation, data visualisation and admin automation.
- Iâ€™m looking to expose myself to new challenges and ways of learning, and see where this journey takes me.
- Fun fact: The first programming language I used was Visual Basic, during high school computing classes.
