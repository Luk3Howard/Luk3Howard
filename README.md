- 👋 Hi, I’m @Luk3Howard
- 👀 I’m interested in developing my coding and tech skills to pursue a career change from Digital Marketing into something more tech-related.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, Python and Django to help with professional and personal projects in areas such as website maintenance, email newsletter creation, Data visualisation and admin automation.
- 💞️ I’m looking to expose myself to new challenges and ways of learning
- ⚡ Fun fact: The first programming language I used was Visual Basic, during high school Computing classes.
